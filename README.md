# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python
# Summary:
This Python project focuses on implementing a Handwritten Digit Recognition application using the MNIST dataset. 
Handwritten digit recognition involves teaching computers to recognize human-written digits, addressing the challenge of variations in writing styles. 
The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and includes the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) to draw digits for immediate recognition.

# About the Project:
The project employs the popular MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from zero to nine. 
The images are represented as a 28x28 matrix of grayscale pixel values. The goal is to train a deep neural network using Python, Keras, and the Tkinter 
library to recognize handwritten digits accurately.

# Implementation Steps:
### Import Libraries and Load Dataset:

Import required modules, including Keras for deep learning.
Load the MNIST dataset using mnist.load_data().

Preprocess the Data:

Reshape the image data to add a dimension suitable for CNN input.
Normalize and preprocess the data for neural network training.
# Create the Model:

Develop a CNN model with convolutional and pooling layers.
Compile the model using the Adadelta optimizer.
Train the Model:

Use the model.fit() function to train the CNN model.
Save the trained model and weights in the 'mnist.h5' file.
Evaluate the Model:

Assess the model's performance on the test dataset.
Display test loss and accuracy.

## Create GUI for Digit Prediction:

Develop a GUI application using Tkinter to draw digits on a canvas.
Implement a prediction function using the trained model to recognize drawn digits.
GUI Digit Recognizer:
The project includes a separate Python file (gui_digit_recognizer.py) for the GUI:

Load the trained model using load_model from Keras.
Create a Tkinter-based GUI with a canvas for drawing digits.
Implement functionality to recognize drawn digits and display results.

# Conclusion:
This project successfully combines deep learning techniques with GUI development to create an interactive Handwritten Digit Recognition application.
The Convolutional Neural Network proves effective for image classification, and the Tkinter-based GUI enhances user experience by allowing digit drawing for real-time recognition.
